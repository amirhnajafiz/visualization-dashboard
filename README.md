## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Filtering**: Remove unnecessary features for focused exploration.
2. **Decoupling Multi-Value Features**: Split multi-value columns for granular analysis.
3. **Linguistic Feature Analysis**: Use NLP to standardize and categorize genres.
4. **Normalization**: Scale numeric values to a common range.
5. **Data Merging**: Combine all datasets into a unified file.
6. **Handling Missing Values**: Fill gaps using linear regression.
7. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminate redundant records.
8. **Data Sampling and Clustering**: Apply PCA and K-Means to reduce dataset size while preserving key patterns.

This ensures clean, consistent, and analysis-ready data.
